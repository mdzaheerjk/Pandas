    "# What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is an open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It gives you \n",
    "powerful, fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to work with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is built on top of NumPy, and its name comes from “Panel Data” (econometrics term for multidimensional data).\n",

    "# Why Pandas? What problem does it solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "People used raw Python lists, dictionaries, or NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structures lacked labels, indexing, grouping, join/merge, handling missing data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world datasets (CSV, JSON, Excel, SQL) are structured in rows and columns — not arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Pandas was designed to work like:\n",

    "📊 Excel + 🧮 NumPy + 🗂️ SQL + 🧰 ETL tools — inside Python\n",
